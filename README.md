## About me


## Project Overview

Dragon Ball Z is a hugely popular Japanese anime series that follows the adult life of the main character Goku. In the action-packed show, Goku and his friends defend their planet from magical villains and intergalactic space fighters. Powerful villains often threaten the heroes and their world. The series originally aired from 1989 to 1996, with new episodes airing from 2009 to 2015. Over the course of 13 years, fans have watched 291 episodes, and true Dragon Ball Z experts have watched them all. Do you know enough about Dragon Ball Z to consider yourself a superfan? Take this quiz to find out!

This quiz is to test your knowledge of Dragon Ballz.

## Mine Contributions

- **As a developer, I need to prepare the game for deployment on various platforms (web, desktop, etc.) so that players can access and play the game in their preferred environment.**

  - The game is packaged and configured for deployment on target platforms.
  - Platform-specific issues are resolved and documented.
  - Deployment instructions are included in the documentation.
  - The game should maintain consistent frame rates and responsiveness.

## Design

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

### Further Testing

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Safari browsers.
- The website was tested on numerous sized screens including Mobile phones, iPads, and laptops, and was found to respond as expected to all sizes. Chrome development tools were used throughout the design process to check responsiveness and breakpoints.
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

## Accesability

## For future implementations, I would like to:

- Connect the application to a database so that I can increase the number of questions on the questions bank.
- Have different levels for the user to play.
- Have the matches saved into the database so the leaderboard would show all users that play the game, not only the ones by the browser.

## Getting Started

First, fork the repository. Then, go into your preferred code editor.

1. git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY]
2. cd game
3. npm install
4. npm run serve

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not the top of the page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
   - Alternatively, Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now-published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not the top of the page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY] in.
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

8. $ git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY]
9. Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
10. remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
11. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
12. remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
13. Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
